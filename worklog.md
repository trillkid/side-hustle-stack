# Side Hustle Stack — Worklog

Shared work record for all agents. Append new sections with `---` separators.

---
Task ID: 1
Agent: main (orchestrator)
Task: Foundation — schema, db, theme, layout, hub shell, overview

Work Log:
- Wrote `prisma/schema.prisma` with all models for 5 modules (FreelanceService/Lead, Product/StoreOrder, ReviewArticle/AffiliateClick, LinkPage/LinkItem, JobApplication/PortfolioProject).
- Ran `bun run db:push` (schema in sync) and seeded demo data via `prisma/seed.ts`.
- Added `src/lib/format.ts` (currency/date/timeAgo helpers) and reduced db logging.
- Added `src/components/theme-provider.tsx` + `src/components/theme-toggle.tsx` (next-themes, light default).
- Updated `src/app/layout.tsx` to wrap children in ThemeProvider.
- Created module stub components under `src/components/modules/{freelance,store,affiliate,linkforge,jobs,overview}/index.tsx`.
- Built full Overview component + `/api/overview` aggregate route (counts + projected earnings).
- Built hub shell `src/app/page.tsx`: sticky header, scrollable tab nav (Overview/Freelance/Store/Affiliate/LinkForge/Jobs), sticky footer.
- Created empty API directories for each module.

Stage Summary:
- DB seeded, dev server running on :3000.
- Hub renders with Overview tab working; module tabs show skeletons (to be replaced by subagents).
- Module contract: each module = `src/components/modules/<name>/index.tsx` (default export, 'use client', self-contained, fetches from `/api/<name>/...`).
- Shared helpers available: `@/lib/db` (Prisma), `@/lib/utils` (cn), `@/lib/format` (formatCurrency/formatDate/timeAgo).
- All shadcn/ui components already exist under `src/components/ui/`.
- Theme = light by default with dark toggle. Avoid indigo/blue primaries; use emerald/amber/red/violet/teal accents per module (see Overview).

Task ID: 2-a
Agent: full-stack-developer (Freelance Hub)
Task: Built the Freelance Hub module — services showcase + lead capture + leads inbox, with full REST API (emerald accent #10b981, no indigo/blue).

Work Log:
- Read existing worklog, dev.log, schema, seed data, and shared helpers (`@/lib/db`, `@/lib/format`, `@/lib/utils`, `useToast`).
- Created API directory tree `src/app/api/freelance/{services,leads/[id]}/`.
- `src/app/api/freelance/services/route.ts`:
  - GET → list active services, newest first, with `_count.leads`.
  - POST → validate title/description/category/price (non-negative number), normalize `icon` against whitelist {Briefcase, Globe, Palette, PenLine, Code2} (default Briefcase), create with `active=true`, return 201 with `_count`.
- `src/app/api/freelance/leads/route.ts`:
  - GET → list leads newest first, include `service`.
  - POST → validate name/email (regex)/message; optional `serviceId` verified active; create with status `new`; return 201 with `service` relation.
- `src/app/api/freelance/leads/[id]/route.ts`:
  - PATCH → validate `status` ∈ {new, contacted, won, lost}, 404 if missing, update + return lead with service.
  - DELETE → 404 if missing, otherwise delete and return `{ok:true}`.
  - Uses async `params` (Next.js 16 dynamic-route signature).
- Overwrote `src/components/modules/freelance/index.tsx` (was a stub) with the full self-contained module:
  - Header row: title "Freelance Hub" + emerald icon chip, subtitle, emerald "Add service" button.
  - Responsive grid `lg:grid-cols-3`: services showcase (lg:col-span-2, sm:grid-cols-2 cards) + leads inbox (lg:col-span-1).
  - Service card: emerald top accent strip, icon (lookup object → lucide), category outline badge, title, 2-line clamped description, emerald price (`formatCurrency`), lead count, "Hire me" button (emerald).
  - "Hire me" Dialog: name/email/service (Select pre-filled with chosen service)/message; client-side validation with inline errors; Loader2 spinner + disabled submit while submitting; success toast + close.
  - "Add service" Dialog: title/description/price/category/icon Select (whitelist); same validation UX.
  - Leads inbox Card: title + emerald count badge; `max-h-[600px] overflow-y-auto` list with custom thin scrollbar; each item shows name, muted email, 2-line clamped message, service title badge, status badge (color-coded: new=sky, contacted=amber, won=emerald, lost=zinc), `timeAgo`, status Select (PATCHes + toasts on change, optimistic with revert), trash icon button → AlertDialog confirm → DELETE + toast.
  - Empty states for both services ("Add your first service") and leads ("No leads yet — share your services!").
  - Loading: `Skeleton` placeholders; Errors: destructive `Alert` with Retry button.
  - After every mutation: refetch / optimistic-update the relevant list and toast.
  - Wrapped in `<div className="space-y-6">`; mobile stacks to single column.
- Verified via curl: all routes return expected status codes (200/201/400/404) for happy + error paths; cleaned up the test service created during API verification.
- Ran `bun run lint` — 0 errors in my files (removed unused `eslint-disable` directives + an unused const). Only a pre-existing warning remains in `store/index.tsx` (not mine).
- Checked `dev.log` tail — no compile errors for any freelance route.

Stage Summary:
- Files created:
  - `src/app/api/freelance/services/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/freelance/leads/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/freelance/leads/[id]/route.ts`
- File overwritten:
  - `src/components/modules/freelance/index.tsx` (full module UI, default export, `'use client'`)
- API endpoints (all under `/api/freelance/...`):
  - `GET/POST /services`
  - `GET/POST /leads`
  - `PATCH/DELETE /leads/[id]`
- Module compiles cleanly, lint clean for my files, all API routes verified end-to-end with curl. Hub → Freelance tab now renders the live module (services from seed data + 2 seeded leads + full CRUD).

Task ID: 2-b
Agent: full-stack-developer (Digital Product Store)
Task: Built the Digital Product Store module — product grid with filters/search, add-product dialog, cart drawer (zustand), mock checkout, and recent-orders panel. Accent: amber (#f59e0b).

Work Log:
- Read worklog.md, schema.prisma, format helpers, hub shell (page.tsx), and shadcn primitives (Sheet/Dialog/Card/Badge/Alert/AspectRatio/Input/Label/Separator/Skeleton) to match conventions.
- Created `src/components/modules/store/cart-store.ts` — zustand store with `items`, `add`, `remove`, `setQty`, `clear`, plus `count`/`subtotal` helpers (in-memory, no persist).
- Created `src/app/api/store/products/route.ts` — GET (list, newest first, optional `?category=` filter) + POST (validated create). Returns `{ products }` / `{ product }`.
- Created `src/app/api/store/orders/route.ts` — GET (newest first, top 50) + POST. POST re-validates every cart line against current DB product prices server-side (drops unknown products, recomputes total), stores `itemsJson`, status defaults to "paid". Returns created order.
- Overwrote `src/components/modules/store/index.tsx` with the full module:
  - Header: amber-accented title, subtitle, "Add product" (outline) + "Cart" (filled, shows item count) buttons.
  - Filters: category pills (All + derived categories) + search Input.
  - Product grid: `sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`, each card uses AspectRatio image with onError fallback to amber-tinted gradient + Package icon, amber category badge, 2-line clamped description, formatCurrency price, "Add to cart" button. Skeletons while loading, destructive Alert + Retry on error, empty state on no results.
  - Add-product Dialog: name/description/price/category/image fields, validated, submit disabled while posting with Loader2 spinner, toast on success → refetch products + orders.
  - Cart Sheet: side="bottom" on mobile / "right" on desktop (via useIsMobile). Qty steppers (− / +), remove (trash), per-line subtotal, footer subtotal + Clear + Checkout (disabled if empty).
  - Checkout Dialog (nested): customer name, email, formatted card number (auto 4-grouped, 16 digits), expiry (MM/YY auto), CVC. Submit → POST /api/store/orders → success state showing order total with CheckCircle2, clear cart, close sheet, toast "Order placed!", refetch orders.
  - Recent orders Card: latest 5 orders with customer name, email, item count (parsed from itemsJson), total (formatCurrency), date (formatDate). Empty state "No orders yet." Skeleton + Alert+Retry for errors. Scrollable list (max-h-96).
- Verified routes via curl: GET products/orders 200, POST product 201 (and 400 on invalid), POST order 201 with server-computed total (29×2=58, ignored client-supplied price of 1) — security check passed.
- Cleaned up test data via Prisma so demo starts with 6 seeded products and 0 orders.
- Ran `bun run lint`: initially 1 warning (unused eslint-disable on `<img>`); removed the directive → lint now passes clean (0 errors, 0 warnings).
- Confirmed dev.log shows store routes compiling and returning 200 with no errors.

Stage Summary:
- Files created: `src/components/modules/store/cart-store.ts`, `src/app/api/store/products/route.ts`, `src/app/api/store/orders/route.ts`.
- Files overwritten: `src/components/modules/store/index.tsx` (full module UI).
- Module is self-contained, default-exported, `'use client'`, fetches only from `/api/store/...`. No schema changes (used existing Product/StoreOrder models).
- Clean compile + clean lint. Ready for the Store tab to render in the hub.

Task ID: 2-c
Agent: full-stack-developer (Affiliate Reviews)
Task: Built the Affiliate Reviews module — a product-review content site that earns affiliate commission on every click. Accent color: red (#ef4444).

Work Log:
- Read worklog + dev.log + Prisma schema + seed data to confirm ReviewArticle/AffiliateClick models and helpers (`@/lib/db`, `@/lib/format`, `@/lib/utils`, `useToast`).
- Created `/api/affiliate/articles/route.ts`:
  • GET — list all articles newest-first, include `_count.clicks`.
  • POST — validate all fields (title/excerpt/content/category/imageUrl/affiliateUrl/productName required; rating must be int 1-5); auto-generate slug from title + 8-char cuid-like suffix for uniqueness.
- Created `/api/affiliate/articles/[slug]/route.ts` — GET single article by slug (with _count clicks), 404 when missing. Used `params: Promise<{slug}>` signature for Next 16.
- Created `/api/affiliate/clicks/route.ts` — POST `{ articleId }` → creates AffiliateClick, returns `{ url: affiliateUrl }`. 404 if article missing, 400 if no articleId.
- Overwrote `src/components/modules/affiliate/index.tsx` with the full module UI:
  • Header row: red icon tile, "Affiliate Reviews" title + "Earn commission on every click" subtitle, red "Write review" button.
  • Performance summary: 3 cards (Total reviews, Total clicks, Estimated commission @ ~$4/click via formatCurrency, with transparent note).
  • Articles grid (`sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`): each card has aspect-video image, red-tinted category badge, star rating (lucide Star, filled = rating), 2-line clamped excerpt, click count, red "Read review" button.
  • Read-review Dialog: image, category badge + stars + click count, title, productName, markdown content rendered via react-markdown with custom component overrides (no @tailwindcss/typography installed — styled headings/paragraphs/lists/code/links manually with red accent for links), prominent red "Check price →" CTA that POSTs to /api/affiliate/clicks, opens returned URL in new tab, toasts "Opening retailer…", and optimistically increments the local click count (with rollback on failure).
  • Write-review Dialog: title, productName, category, rating via interactive StarPicker (5 clickable stars), excerpt, markdown content textarea (with "Markdown supported" hint), imageUrl, affiliateUrl. Submit button shows Loader2 spinner while submitting, disabled during submit. Successful POST → toast → reset form → refetch list.
  • Skeleton loaders (6 placeholder cards) while loading; destructive Alert with Retry button on error; friendly empty state with CTA when no articles.
- Removed 2 unused `eslint-disable-next-line @next/next/no-img-element` comments that Next 16/Turbopack no longer reports (lint was warning about them).
- Verified all routes end-to-end with curl: GET list 200, GET single 200, GET missing 404, POST create 201 (slug = `test-affiliate-article-7cfd0vfu` ✓), POST validation 400, POST click 200 returns affiliate URL. Then deleted the test article via Prisma to restore clean seed state (3 articles).
- Ran `bun run lint` — 0 errors in my files (only 1 pre-existing warning in store module, not mine).

Stage Summary:
- Files created:
  • `src/app/api/affiliate/articles/route.ts`
  • `src/app/api/affiliate/articles/[slug]/route.ts`
  • `src/app/api/affiliate/clicks/route.ts`
- Files modified:
  • `src/components/modules/affiliate/index.tsx` (overwrote stub with full UI)
- Dev log: clean compiles, all affiliate routes returning expected status codes (200/201/400/404), no errors.
- Lint: clean for my files.
- Module is ready to view in the Preview Panel — click the "Affiliate" tab in the hub.

Task ID: 2-e
Agent: full-stack-developer (Jobs & Portfolio)
Task: Built Job Tracker (kanban) + Portfolio gallery module for the Side Hustle Stack. Accent: sky (#0ea5e9).

Work Log:
- Read worklog + Prisma schema + seed data + existing modules' patterns; confirmed `JobApplication` & `PortfolioProject` models already exist & are seeded (5 apps + 3 projects).
- Created 4 API route files under `src/app/api/jobs/`:
  - `applications/route.ts` — GET (newest first) + POST (validated create; coerces/defaults status to `wishlist`, parses `appliedDate`, allows null for nullable fields).
  - `applications/[id]/route.ts` — PATCH (partial update of any field incl. status; 404 if missing) + DELETE (404 if missing). Uses Next 16 async `params: Promise<{ id: string }>`.
  - `portfolio/route.ts` — GET (newest first) + POST (validated create).
  - `portfolio/[id]/route.ts` — PATCH (optional per spec) + DELETE.
- Overwrote `src/components/modules/jobs/index.tsx` (was a stub) with the full self-contained `'use client'` module:
  - Header row: sky icon tile + "Jobs & Portfolio" title, subtitle, "Add application" (sky filled) and "Add project" (outline) buttons.
  - Summary strip: 3 stat badges — total applications (sky), interviewing count (amber), offers count (emerald).
  - Section 1 — Kanban: `flex gap-4 overflow-x-auto` with 5 Cards (Wishlist/Applied/Interview/Offer/Rejected), each ~280px wide with colored dot + count badge; column body `max-h-[520px] overflow-y-auto` with thin custom scrollbar styling (`[scrollbar-width:thin]` + webkit pseudo classes).
  - Application card: company (bold), role, optional sky salary badge + applied date (formatDate), in-card `Select` for quick status change (optimistic + PATCH + refetch + revert on error + toast), external-link button (if `link`), edit button (opens Dialog), delete button (opens AlertDialog confirm). Column accents per spec: zinc / sky / amber / emerald / rose.
  - Section 2 — Portfolio: Card titled "Portfolio" with count; grid `sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`. Each project card: aspect-video image (if `imageUrl`) OR sky→emerald gradient placeholder with project initial; title; 2-line clamped description; tag badges (split by comma); sky "Open" button (if url) + delete button (AlertDialog confirm).
  - Reusable `ApplicationFormDialog` (create + edit modes — pre-fills fields when editing) and `PortfolioFormDialog` (create). Both: required-field validation, disabled-while-submitting, Loader2 spinner, toasts on success/error, dialog closes + refetch on success.
  - Controlled AlertDialogs for delete confirmations (regular destructive Button — never auto-closes while deletion is in-flight, only closes after success).
  - Parallel fetch on mount, Skeleton loaders for both sections (matching the real layout shape), destructive `Alert` with Retry button on load failure for either list.
- Verified via curl end-to-end: GET 200, POST 201 (valid), POST 400 (missing required fields), PATCH 200 (status move + field update), PATCH 404 (unknown id), DELETE 200, DELETE 404 — on both applications and portfolio endpoints. Cleaned up test records after verification.
- `bun run lint`: initially 1 warning about an unused `eslint-disable @next/next/no-img-element` directive (the rule isn't enforced in this project config); removed the directive → now 0 errors / 0 warnings.
- `dev.log` shows clean compiles, `GET /api/jobs/applications 200` and `GET /api/jobs/portfolio 200` with no errors after my edits.

Stage Summary:
- Files created:
  - `src/app/api/jobs/applications/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/jobs/applications/[id]/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/jobs/portfolio/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/jobs/portfolio/[id]/route.ts`
  - `agent-ctx/2-e-full-stack-developer.md`
- File overwritten:
  - `src/components/modules/jobs/index.tsx` (full kanban + portfolio UI, default export, `'use client'`, self-contained)
- Module integrates into existing hub via the already-wired `JobsModule` import in `src/app/page.tsx`.
- Clean compile + clean lint. The "Jobs & Portfolio" tab in the hub now renders the live module (5 seeded applications across columns + 3 seeded portfolio projects with tag badges). No indigo / default-blue used as a dominant brand color — sky is the accent, with zinc/amber/emerald/rose for column differentiation.

Task ID: 2-d
Agent: full-stack-developer (LinkForge SaaS)
Task: Built LinkForge — a link-in-bio SaaS module with page settings, link CRUD + reorder, live phone preview, plan toggle (Free/Pro), and analytics. Accent: violet (#8b5cf6).

Work Log:
- Read worklog + schema + seed to understand context (one seeded LinkPage "demo" with plan=pro, 4 links).
- Created API routes:
  - `src/app/api/linkforge/page/route.ts` — GET (first page + ordered links + totalClicks) and PATCH (title/bio/themeColor/plan with hex/enum validation).
  - `src/app/api/linkforge/links/route.ts` — GET (ordered list) and POST (new link, order = max+1, validates label+url).
  - `src/app/api/linkforge/links/[id]/route.ts` — PATCH (label/url/order) and DELETE; uses Next 16 async `params` pattern.
  - `src/app/api/linkforge/links/[id]/click/route.ts` — POST increments clicks, returns `{ url, clicks }`.
- Overwrote `src/components/modules/linkforge/index.tsx`:
  - Self-contained 'use client' module, fetches `/api/linkforge/page` on mount with Skeleton loaders + destructive Alert + retry on error.
  - Header card: LinkForge title, plan Switch (Free/Pro), violet PRO badge / FREE badge + upsell note.
  - Two-column grid (lg:grid-cols-2): left = Page settings (title Input, bio Textarea with counter, theme color row of 6 preset swatches + custom `<input type="color">`, Save button + blur-save) and Links editor (per-row label/url inputs, up/down arrows for reorder via order-swap PATCHes, dirty-aware Save button, AlertDialog delete confirm, clicks badge, external link, Add-link form at bottom). Right = live phone mockup (aspect-9/19, status bar, avatar with initials, title, bio, themed link buttons that record a click + open URL on tap, violet PRO ribbon, LinkForge footer) above a read-only published URL `linkforge.app/demo` with copy button that toasts "Copied!".
  - Full-width Analytics card: total clicks, link count, plan, avg/link KPI tiles + per-link horizontal bars scaled to max, themed with the selected themeColor.
  - Live preview mirrors local draft state (draftTitle/draftBio/draftColor/linkDrafts) so phone updates as you type.
  - After every mutation: refetch with `skipNextDraftSync` ref so unsaved in-progress edits aren't overwritten.
  - Toasts for save/add/delete/reorder/plan/copy; Loader2 spinners on all async buttons; disabled-while-submitting everywhere.
- Verified: `curl` tested GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE/click all return 200; `bun run lint` clean (0 errors, 0 warnings); dev.log shows no compile errors for any linkforge route.

Stage Summary:
- Files created:
  - `src/app/api/linkforge/page/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/linkforge/links/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/linkforge/links/[id]/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/linkforge/links/[id]/click/route.ts`
- Files modified:
  - `src/components/modules/linkforge/index.tsx` (replaced stub with full UI)
- Issues hit & fixed: none — Next 16 async `params` pattern used correctly on dynamic routes; verified nested Tooltip→AlertDialogTrigger Slot composition works without errors.
- Clean compile confirmed via dev.log + lint.

Task ID: 3
Agent: main (orchestrator)
Task: Integration + end-to-end verification

Work Log:
- Confirmed hub `src/app/page.tsx` imports all 5 module components + Overview; tab switching verified live.
- Overview component (`src/components/modules/overview/index.tsx`) + `/api/overview` aggregate route provide cross-module stats and projected earnings.
- Fixed a layout bug in the Affiliate reader dialog: article image (`aspect-video`) was too tall and the CTA button fell below the fold where the headless clicker (and real users on short viewports) couldn't reach it. Shrunk image to `h-40 sm:h-52` and made the DialogFooter `sticky bottom-0` with a backdrop-blur background so the affiliate CTA is always visible/clickable.
- Ran `bun run lint` → 0 errors, 0 warnings.

Stage Summary:
- All 6 tabs render real data from the seeded DB.
- Sticky footer verified: wrapper uses `min-h-screen flex flex-col`, footer uses `mt-auto` — footer sticks on short pages and pushes down naturally on long pages (confirmed footerBottom=1116 on a 900px viewport with overflowing content; no overlap).

---
Task ID: 4
Agent: main (orchestrator)
Task: End-to-end browser verification with Agent Browser

Work Log:
- Opened http://localhost:3000/ — page rendered with header, 6 tabs, footer (no hydration errors, clean console).
- Overview tab: projected earnings $13.00 (Affiliate $4 + LinkForge Pro $9), 4 services, 2 leads, 6 products, 3 articles, 95 link clicks, 5 job apps, 1 offer — all real aggregated data.
- Freelance tab: 4 service cards + 2 leads rendered. Tested "Hire me" → filled lead form → submit → POST /api/freelance/leads 201, lead appeared in inbox, dialog closed. ✓
- Store tab: 6 products rendered. Added 2 to cart (Notion $29 + Invoice Pack $19), opened cart sheet (qty steppers worked), checkout dialog showed "Pay $48.00", filled form → POST /api/store/orders 201, "Order placed!" toast, order listed. ✓
- Affiliate tab: 3 articles rendered. Opened Blue Yeti reader (markdown rendered), clicked "Check price →" → POST /api/affiliate/clicks 200, opened Amazon in new tab (verified redirect). ✓ (after the layout fix)
- LinkForge tab: editor + live phone preview + analytics rendered. Toggled Free/Pro switch → PATCH /api/linkforge/page 200, toast fired. ✓
- Jobs tab: 5-column kanban (wishlist/applied/interview/offer/rejected) + 3 portfolio projects rendered. Changed an application status via Radix Select → PATCH /api/jobs/applications/[id] 200. ✓
- Responsive: screenshotted at 1280×900 (desktop) and 390×844 (mobile); horizontal-scroll tab nav works on mobile.
- Console/errors: empty — no runtime or hydration errors.

Stage Summary:
- Site is fully interactive and runnable. Every primary user flow verified end-to-end in the browser with successful API calls.
- No outstanding defects. The app is complete.

Task ID: 5
Agent: main (orchestrator)
Task: AI reply assistant for freelance leads

Work Log:
- Removed the test lead (client@test.com) created during Task 4 verification; 3 real leads remain.
- Loaded the LLM skill (z-ai-web-dev-sdk, server-side only).
- Created API route `src/app/api/freelance/leads/[id]/reply/route.ts` — POST fetches the lead + its service, builds a system+user prompt, calls ZAI.chat.completions.create, returns { draft, subject, to, leadName }. Includes a graceful fallback template if the model is unavailable.
- Prompt engineering: warm/professional tone, 120-180 words, references the lead's specific message + service details + price, asks ONE scoping question, ends with [Your name] placeholder, no invented contact info.
- Added `ReplyDialog` component to the freelance module: auto-generates draft on open, editable subject + body, word count, Copy button, Regenerate button (different tone), and "Open in email" (mailto: link that opens the user's own email client pre-filled — user sends it themselves).
- Wired a "Reply" button (Wand2 icon, emerald accent) into each lead card in the LeadsInbox.
- Auto-advances a lead from "new" to "contacted" once a reply is drafted (calls existing handleStatusChange).
- Verified end-to-end: Priya's lead → AI drafted a personalized reply mentioning her pottery studio + 2-week timeline + $450 price → mailto link correctly pre-filled → lead auto-advanced to "contacted".
- Lint: 0 errors, 0 warnings.

Stage Summary:
- 3 real leads ready to reply to: Thomas bowyer-marche, Priya Sharma, Marcus Lee.
- User can now draft a personalized AI reply per lead with one click, edit it, and open it in their email client to send — they stay in control of actually sending.
- The app does NOT send emails itself (no email integration, and we don't impersonate the user to third parties).
